# Workflow block examples

This repo contains examples to use the workflow block builder in monday. 

Each folder is a standalone app. I recommend using degit to download each example app separately. This also lets you clone without any git history. 


For example, to install the notification block sample - 
```
npx degit https://github.com/yuhgto/workflow-block-examples/notification-action-block
```
